# GBE: A Game Boy Emulator
This emulator is the result of a serie of live coding videos in which it was written from scratch in C++ 

This has been my first attemp to create an emulator, so the idea wasn't do a perfect one (there are a lot of them in internet) but learn the basics of emulation and enjoy the experience :) So, to me, it was more importante clear code that optimized one. In the end, more or less the 65% of games tested are playable.

Since first video, I realized that an important tool to make the work easiest was a debugger. So I've created one, not only to display and run the code, but to display the memory, tiles and sprites.

The videos are in spanish and can been seen here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaoYf3oTPg9pMhMWmTsIsgOCdbpnrTqcp

To build the emulator, download the code and open the project with Visual Studio 2015.
